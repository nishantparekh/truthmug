<div id="about1"><h3>About Truthmug</h3><br /> Truthmug is a new  social networking website that allows it&#39;s users to stay anonymous while using the site. 
 Truthmug connects people and allows them to share their true feeling related to any other user whilst staying anonymous.
 Here you create a profile of your's which is called a "mug" where people whom you give permission to are only allowed to write.
 Here you can write whatever you feel about a particular person and stay anonymous depending if you have the permission from that person or not.
 In case you don't have the permission from the other person, you won't be able to write on his/her profile.
 <br />
 <br />
Apart from keeping users anonymous, another unique and interesting feature offered by truthmug is that in case the other user wants to remove the post that any other person has written on his/her mug(profile), the particular post will be removed after around two hours from the time the user clicks on the "remove" button. This would give other users on truthmug a chance to read what has been written about that particular user. 
 <br />
 <br />
 Here on Truthmug, we offer the user to create a " Watchlist". A watchlist is a list of specific set of maximum 15 people who the user wants to keep a watch on. In the watchlist the user will keep getting updates as to the new and the leaving posts from the profile of the users present in watchlist.<br />
You can also view other people's watchlists and view their respective profiles.
 <br />
 <br />
 Truthmug is created to serve as a platform
where each and everyone can speak all that they want. <br /> Be it a feeling of love, hatred, anger or just a compliment, take it out all here
on Truthmug. Please note that while writing try not to hurt the sentiments of other person in any way.<br />
Some of that include:<br/>1. Use of abusive language.<br />2. Writing about the relegion of the person <br />3. Making false accusitions
against the other person.<br />
