Anonymous Social networking. 
This website is based on anonymous social networking. Here you can send a friend request and connect with people you know 
as happens on similar common social networking sites. You can post on someones wall whatever you want withouth disclosing
your identity (remaning anonymous). The catch comes when the person wants to delete. As soon as you try to delete a post 
on your profile, it notifies all your friends that you are trying to delete a post from your wall. 
Watchlist: The watchlist consists of a list of friends that you can keep a watch on and know if they have new posts on their
wall and if they're trying to delete something as well.
